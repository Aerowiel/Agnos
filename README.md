# What is it ?

Agnos is an anonymous chatroom that stores no communication between users.
You can use it to create totally anonymous, ephemeral chat rooms.
All you have to do is create a chat room from the home page and share the link with your friend(s).

# Why ?

It's a portfolio project, and I thought it was a good idea, so I did it.

# Credits

I had a bit of trouble choosing the colors for the terminal, so I took inspiration from a terminal-shaped website I found during my design research.
Here's the project: https://github.com/m4tt72/terminal
All credit to m4tt72 for the chat colors!
Feel free to have a look too!
